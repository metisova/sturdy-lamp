## How to create an issue

1. Go to `Issues` tab in the repository and click on the green `New issue` button

2. Fill out the issue template:
    
    2.1. `Dependencies` - if the issue is waiting on another issue

    2.2. `Problem` - what are we solving

    2.3. `Solution suggestion` - suggest a solution

    2.4. `Acceptance criteria` - issue outcomes, what have we achieved?

    2.5. `Learning outcome` - how did we benefit from it personally, what did we learn?

3. Add relevant labels:

    3.1. Estimate how long the issue is going to take (1h / 2h / 3h)

        If it takes more than 3 hours, then it should be split (e.g. into research and actual implementation)

    3.2. Choose a priority (low / medium / high)

    3.3. Choose if it's BE or FE

        If you need other labels, feel free to add them


4. Add it to the `Sturdy lamp` project

5. Assign a person who should solve the issue

6. Click on a `Submit a new issue` button

> *If any of the steps are not clear, just skip them and create an issue anyway. We can always refine it later once we have more info.*

## How to pick an issue

1. Go to `Issues` tab

2. Filter issues by `High` label and by an assignee

3. Open an issue and read its description carefully:

    3.1. Check that it doesn't have any open dependencies

    3.2. Check that you understand the problem and the suggested solution.
        
        If it's not clear, then tag the author in the comments and ask for more details.

        ---

        If you don't agree with anything in the description, then also describe it in the comments.

    3.3. If all is clear, then change issue status in the project from `Todo` to `In Progress`
